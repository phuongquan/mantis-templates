# mantis-templates

This repository contains templates for creating bespoke Rmd reports containing
`mantis` visualisations. Remember to choose the branch that corresponds to the
version of `mantis` you are using. The main branch corresponds to the current
release version of `mantis`.

The template Rmd files are located in the `/templates` folder.

## Usage

First install `mantis`

``` r
install.packages("mantis")
```

### Option 1

Run the `main.R` file to generate the basic template report and save it to a
subfolder called `output`.

### Option 2

Knit the `basic-template-standalone.Rmd` file directly within RStudio.
