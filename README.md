# mantis-templates

This repository contains templates for creating bespoke Rmd reports containing
`mantis` visualisations. Remember to choose the branch that corresponds to the
version of `mantis` you are using. The main branch corresponds to the current
release version of `mantis`.

Run the `main.R` file to generate the example reports.

The template Rmd files are located in the `/templates` folder.
